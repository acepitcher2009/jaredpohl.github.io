## Welcome to Jared Pohl' portfolio

## Self Assessment:

As I have progressed through the computer science program, I have obtained many skills that have allowed me to step into the tech world and be successful. The skills I have obtained that have allowed for me to be a successful developer include team collaboration, communication to stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database usage, and security. All these skills have shaped me in a way that has significantly improved my ability to be a developer.

The skills I have learned through team collaboration have helped me to be successful in a team setting. This includes when other team members completely ruin a repository. What I mean by this is when I was in the course that taught us team collaboration the class encountered an issue where the repository that was in use had been completely altered to where the code that was needed for the assignments was no longer within the repository. This allowed me and other classmates to collaborate and work on a solution to revert the changes made to the repository so that we could recover the code that was deleted in a commit. This taught me the value of teamwork in the tech field. With this skill and value learned it has allowed me to be more valuable as a team member to the development team that I currently work on.

I also learned the values of communicating with stakeholders. Learning this skill has taught me to never just jump into a project. What I mean by this is that sometimes I have received an issue to work on for a project in my current role and the instructions were not clear. Learning this skill has allowed me to analyze what is needed in the feature and to ask questions if what is wanted is not clear. For instance, I have received an issue at work recently that has to deal with form validation. The team lead was not the person who created the issue. However, I looked at the issue and reviewed the code to see what was needed for the issue. After reviewing this information, it was not clear as to what form fields needed to be validated. Thus, leading to me getting clarity from the team lead for the issue. This is important because sometimes stakeholders will not always give you a clear understanding of what a feature should be and the behavior of the feature. 

Learning data structures and algorithms was tough for me. Not because of the critical thinking that is needed to understand what algorithm or data structure should be used but because this skill was learned through a language that was hardly touched on within the program. I learned this skill using the C++ coding language. However, learning this skill has helped me change my mindset from analytical thinking which is mainly used in the mechanical fields I have normally been in to critically thinking. What I mean by this is when a mechanic diagnoses and issue they are analyzing different parameter readings from scanners and other devices but when a feature is needing data and needs that data used in a certain way you must think critically to choose the correct data structure and algorithm. This is because you will need to ensure that the data structure chosen is able to hold and access the data as efficiently as possible. Same goes for algorithms. Algorithms need to be chosen by most efficient. This does not always apply to every role in the computer science field, however. For instance, a front-end web developer will not use binary trees, hash maps, or even linked lists within a project. They will mostly use arrays. This is true because I have noticed a lot of the data structures, I use personally at work are arrays and nothing that could potentially be more efficient. 

When learning software engineering and database skills from this program, I feel that I have grown more from learning these skills than that of any other skill I have learned in this program. I feel this way because when I was learning data structures and algorithms I found that being able to apply logic is more important than being able to remember what data structure to use when. I say this because any project in the tech field, from a developer/software engineers view, with require more logical thinking than that of any data structure. Like wise with databases, you will not only need to be able to set up a database, but you will also need to be able to communicate with it as well. This also requires logical thinking. I say this because when communicating with databases you will need to have error handling involved. This is because if you request certain data from the database an error will provide information regarding why the communication failed if the information is not in there or if the information is incorrect. 
	
I didnâ€™t take any classes relating to security in this program. However, as I have progressed in my career as a front-end developer, I have found that security is a huge part of the computer science field. This is because we want to be able to allow users of projects to know that the information they are working with or on is safe. To allow users to have the safe feeling when using an application, security can be set in place through different methods. The main method I have found throughout my, so far, short career is through authentication when logging into the application. With this method the user is presented a bearer token behind the scenes allowing for them to access and utilize the application.
  
  
For this project I have chosen to rewrite an application that was initially a single page application. I chose to rewrite this project because it allowed me to showcase skills such as software engineering and design, data structures and algorithms, the use of database. To showcase my skills as a developer I utilized a MongoDB Atlas database. This database is a cloud database which allows for users to utilize this application from anywhere with out the need of a server in every location the application would or could be used. I also utilized the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) tech stack to develop this application. I chose this tech stack because it aligned with skills I have learned from my current role and would allow me to not only display my knowledge and ability to use this tech stack but also allow for refinement of basic abilities within this tech stack. Within this application, to showcase my skills within software engineering and design, you will find a simple, easy to use design for this application. You will also find that there are multiple pages within this application that allow for different functionalities within the CRUD operations. Also found in this application is the use of arrays. Using arrays and applying logical functions to them allow for the display of the skills learned from the data structures and algorithms course. The final piece you will find within this application is the database and the logic on the backend for communication with the database. This showcases my abilities to create and use a database within a project. As a whole this project shows my ability to develop a full stack application from start to finish.
